## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the club from first glance.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see if I could find out further information on the club.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the manager of a team.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the club secretary or comittee member.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find links to Oranmore Maree - One club (another code of Club) or Club Zap for membership payment.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added photos to the gallery.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to access social media to see updates on club/games or downloads to see club info.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to see links to Galway LGFA (they don't have a website at present), Connacht LGFA & LGFA.
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used are cornflower blue, white and black - to match the colours of the club crest. I included light gray as a background               color- rather than white as I liked the way it blends in with the website, and it clearly defines the sections on the pages.
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used for headings, with Roboto as second font throughout the whole website. Sans Serif as the                 fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
            Montserrat is a modern font, which I feel is attractive and used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.               Roboto was recommended in google fonts as a second font to use with Montserrat, and I 
            liked the look of it so that is why I chose it.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, hero image on the index.html page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention as soon as             they access the webpage.
            It also has an energetic aesthetically position with the transition attached to it.
